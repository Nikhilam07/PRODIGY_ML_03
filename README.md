# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of cats and dogs using **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** features. It is based on a publicly available image dataset from Kaggle and uses classical machine learning techniques to achieve robust classification performance without deep learning.
